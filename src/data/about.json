    "I’m Dan, a self-taught front-end dev with ${timeDeveloping} years of experience, and I love building cool things for the web. From responsive HTML emails at DEG, to banners and landing pages at MMGY, to leading Vue-based projects at Intouch Solutions and VF Corp, I’ve built everything from interactive product pages for The North Face to an e-commerce site for Synthroid with Angular 8. With ${timeWebDeveloping} years as a Front-End Developer and ${timeWithVue} years in Vue—think custom boilerplates, Veeva integrations, and this site in Vue 3—I love solving problems with clean, scalable code. Let’s build something together!",
